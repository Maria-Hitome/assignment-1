            <h1><span class="tomato-color">Mission 2022</span></h1>
            <p>Working in dark room or learning about large format camera or documenting for any project, or working in
                studio,
                everything what I did was so remarkable and momentous to me and created lots of significant spaces of
                every
                part
                of my life and my vision. I was determined to complete this degree with very valuable work. In the
                beginning, I
                used to get very frustrated for every critique I was having in my classes, but I never stopped. I was
                determined
                that I need to shoot and make enduring photos.

                I always wanted to be an artist but never got the chance to follow my dream. Specially for being a
                Muslim girl from a south Asian country named Bangladesh, where most of the time it is tough to follow
                heart. But when I came here in 2016, I got to know about FIT has a lot of programs based on art and
                photography and started researching how can I get into here

            <p>
                Because there are lot of people who think there is nothing to learn or to get a degree necessary in
                photography, but I want to change that, by my work as well as by my teaching activity. I want to teach
                photography everywhere in the world. And I need a strong platform for that. That is why I have chosen
                BFA
                in photography at FIT.
